* How much to produce?

	* price of the product
	* some data on the demand of the product

#### Example
* Making operations decisions for a retailer who orders a product from a supplier and sells it to customers
	* ordered product items are received and placed on store shelf
	* large customer population
		* may choose to buy or not buy the product
		* customer chooses to buy, arrives at the store to buy the product
		* buys it as long as it is available on the shelf
	* get only one chance to order (cannot change your purchase after your decision)
